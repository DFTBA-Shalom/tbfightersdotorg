				<h2>UNDER THREAT</h2>
				<p>As Trump took office in January, his administration swiftly moved to dismantle USAID
					funding. </p>
				<br>
				<p>In his first week in office, <b>he signed an executive order freezing foreign
						aid</b>, including USAID and the United States President’s Emergency
					Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for 90 days for the administration to review the
					agency. But experts questioned the legitimacy of this review.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Later that week, the Secretary of State issued a temporary waiver for life saving
					treatment, which to our knowledge has has only been sparingly granted to some
					organizations.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As the weeks progressed, <b>USAID’s website was taken down</b> while <b>thousands of
						workers were fired</b>, including overseas workers who were working in
					the field to give care to millions of people around the world.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Recently, the administration has announced that it will <b>permanently shutter 90% of
						USAID's contracts</b> as USAID workers got their last chance to retrieve
					their belongings after being fired.</p>

				<p>Recently, the current administration has been restoring some contracts, but not all.
					This is insanely good news, but there are still millions of dollars not
					distributed, causing people to die. But what this does show is that <i>we can
						make a difference.</i> Some of these contracts were restored due to
					pressure from people like you! Others were restored due to court cases, in which
					judges went against the current administration, which has levied threats against
					judges that gave them unfavorable rulings, in part due to support from people
					like you. But we have to continue to remind our congresspeople, the current
					administration and people around the world that we still want the money to flow.
					<b>One of the best ways to do that is to call you congresspeople using the
						templates below and to spread the world</b>

				<br>
				<p><b>Countries other than the US have also cut foreign aid funding.</b> Much of the
					same points laid out above still apply: cutting foreign aid will cost lives. We
					have made templates for what you can say to your elected officials about these
					cuts. <i>If you country hasen't cut funding</i>, that is great! But we ask you
					to ask your elected officials to fill in the gap left by the US and other
					countries. You can find templates for that below too.</p>
